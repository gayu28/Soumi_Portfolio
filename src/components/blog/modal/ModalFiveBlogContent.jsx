        The project focuses on analyzing the reach of an entity to the public. Twitter, one of the most preferred microblogging sites, is chosen for the analysis. By finding out the overall sentiment from the tweets associated with the concerned entity, it becomes handy to calculate the entity's reach. Such analysis is crucial for the present world where business companies are hugely investing and rapidly growing. The tweets are directly fetched from the platform from which the sentiments are fetched and analyzed. This is followed by building a predictive model that predicts a given tweet's sentiment.
